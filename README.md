# Day 3: [Nesting Your Sass](http://leveluptuts.com/tutorials/sass-tutorials/3-nesting-your-sass)
How this all works:  If you want to, you can just watch the video linked above at leveluptuts.com. Or, if you're more of a reader than a watcher, I've recapped the video tutorials here, and added a few thoughts of my own. Keep in mind that I kind of named things differently, etc. so if you're trying to watch the video AND do these walkthroughs at the same time, you might get a bit confused. You don't need to grab all the files - the files for each branch are the completed lesson files. So unless you get stuck, you shouldn't need to snag everything, just read the README and follow along.

## 1. Setup
 You can continue with the files you used in Day 2, with a couple of minor modifiations. (see branch Day_2)
 
 Inside the content div, add a second h2, add a class to the first p, and add an anchor around the first word in the paragraph.
 
 ```
     ...
     <div class="content">
     <h2>this is another h2</h2>
     <p class="paragraph1"><a href="#">Drag√©e</a>
     ...
 ```

 
 Start up sass from the command line:
 
 ```
 sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
 ```

## 2. Nesting
Instead of creating new rules for specific elements and classes inside of the content div, you can nest those rules right inside of the rule for the content class. This organizes things nicely.

```
.content {
  width:60%;
  margin:$margin;
  padding:$padding;
  h2 {
    background-color:$secondary + 50;
  }
  .paragraph1 {
    color:$primary;
    a {
      font-size:16pt;
      font-weight:bold;
      color:magenta;
    }
  }
}
```
