# Day 18 Updating your Sass version
How this all works:  If you want to, you can just watch the video linked above at leveluptuts.com. Or, if you're more of a reader than a watcher, I've recapped the video tutorials here, and added a few thoughts of my own. Keep in mind that I kind of named things differently, etc. so if you're trying to watch the video AND do these walkthroughs at the same time, you might get a bit confused. You don't need to grab all the files - the files for each branch are the completed lesson files. So unless you get stuck, you shouldn't need to snag everything, just read the README and follow along.

## 1. Shhh

So, the LevelUpTuts Day 18 video is all about updating Sass...to a version that is already older than the one you are using if you started at Day 1 from this repo. 
Which means:  YOU GET THE DAY OFF! Go grab some coffee and check your favorite social media feed for ten minutes instead. :)

but... if you really want to know how to update your version of Sass, because someday you might need to do that...basically, you just reinstall the sass gem - so go peek at (Day 1)[https://github.com/stuller/30DaysOfSass/tree/Day_1]!
